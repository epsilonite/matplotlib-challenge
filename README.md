# Pymaceuticals
This challenge has us as the senior data analyst for Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications, where we are tasked with a top-level summary of the results and generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
